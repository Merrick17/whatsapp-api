# WAHA (WhatsApp HTTP API) Python examples

## Installation

We assume that you have installed software:

1. Python 3
2. Docker

### Download and start image

First of all, you must run WhatsApp HTTP API locally (which under the hood it runs real WhatsApp Web instance and expose
HTTP API for interaction).

Here are the steps from [Quick Start](https://waha.devlike.pro/docs/overview/quick-start/):

Download and start WhatsApp HTTP API docker container

```bash
# Download the image
docker pull devlikeapro/whatsapp-http-api
# Run the docker container
docker run -it --rm --network=host -e WHATSAPP_HOOK_URL=http://localhost:5000/bot -e "WHATSAPP_HOOK_EVENTS=*" --name whatsapp-http-api devlikeapro/whatsapp-http-api

# It prints logs and the last line must be
# WhatsApp HTTP API is running on: http://[::1]:3000
```

#### Download image - ARM

If you're using ARM (like Apple Silicon, Apple M1, etc) - use following commands to download the image

![](/images/versions/core.png) For Core version the command is
```bash
# Download the image
docker pull devlikeapro/whatsapp-http-api:arm
# Rename it, so you can use devlikeapro/whatsapp-http-api image in other place
docker tag devlikeapro/whatsapp-http-api:arm devlikeapro/whatsapp-http-api
# Run the docker container
docker run -it --rm --network=host -e WHATSAPP_HOOK_URL=http://localhost:5000/bot -e "WHATSAPP_HOOK_EVENTS=*" --name whatsapp-http-api devlikeapro/whatsapp-http-api

# It prints logs and the last line must be
# WhatsApp HTTP API is running on: http://[::1]:3000
```

### Start session and scan QR

2. Open Swagger API in the browser http://localhost:3000/
3. Start session and scan QR code in swagger
    1. Find `POST /api/session/start` request press **Try it out** and **Execute** it with `default` session name
    2. Find `GET /api/screenshot` and execute it - it must show QR code
    3. Scan QR code on your mobile WhatsApp application (that installed on your phone)
    4. Execute `GET /api/screenshot` once again - it must show the screenshot from WhatsApp Web.
4. Send test text message - find `POST /api/sendText` and execute it with payload (change `12132132130` in the `chatId`
   to phone number that is registered in WhatsApp).

```json
{
  "chatId": "12132132130@c.us",
  "text": "Hi there!",
  "session": "default"
}
```

If you see **Hi there!** message then you're ready to run bots!

## WhatsApp Echo Bot

The WhatsApp Echo Bot is a sample flask webhook server application that echoes back to you whatever you send it. It can
serve
as a basic reference for how to set up webhooks and reply to incoming messages.

```bash
# Clone the git repository with example
git clone https://github.com/devlikeapro/whatsapp-http-api.git
# Open python example folder
cd whatsapp-http-api/examples/python
# Install requirements
python -mpip install -r requirements.txt
# Run the bot
FLASK_APP=whatsapp_echo_bot.py flask run
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:5000/bot - if you see **WhatsApp Echo Bot is ready!** then the bot is ready to receive message!

Send message to the WhatsApp (that you used to scan QR code) and it'll echo text back to you!

## WhatsApp Download Files Bot

The WhatsApp Download Image Bot downloads all files people send to your WhatsApp and log the path for the file.

**The bot works only with WAHA Plus version** available with donations.
Visit [read more about difference between Core and Plus versions](https://waha.devlike.pro/docs/how-to/plus-version/).

Download **WAHA Plus** version:

```bash
# Download the image
docker pull devlikeapro/whatsapp-http-api-plus
# Run the docker container
docker run -it --rm --network=host -e WHATSAPP_HOOK_URL=http://localhost:5000/bot -e "WHATSAPP_HOOK_EVENTS=*" --name whatsapp-http-api devlikeapro/whatsapp-http-api-plus
```

```bash
# Clone the git repository with example
git clone https://github.com/devlikeapro/whatsapp-http-api.git
# Open python example folder
cd whatsapp-http-api/examples/python
# Install requirements
python -mpip install -r requirements.txt
# Run the bot
FLASK_APP=whatsapp_download_files_bot.py flask run
