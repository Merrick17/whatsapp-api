## Donations

WAHA Plus version is available through **donations** (subscriptions).

**It doesn't require monthly subscriptions, once installed on your server - it always works!**
(until WhatsApp made backward-incompatible changes, and you have to update the image)

{{< alert icon="üí°" text="No licence checks or expiration on already installed instances!" />}}
We do not sell **WAHA**, it's not a purchase. It's a donation.

We treat our projects like art. You donate to the project and get a bit more from it as a thank-you. üòä

Treat **WAHA Plus** it as an additional episode, behind-the-scenes videos, our nude photos üòä

{{< alert icon="üí°" text="WAHA does not have license checks and expiration - because art can not expire! Enjoy it till it works!" />}}

We donate most of the donations down to the stream to the underlying libraries and tools - JS-community, Node, other libraries authors, personal contributors.
By donating to the **WAHA** you donate to the Open Source world!
